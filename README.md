# Homes Angular Project üè°

This repository contains the **Homes** project I developed while completing an online Angular course.  
The project showcases my learning journey and serves as a practical example of building dynamic, interactive web applications using Angular.  

I created this project for my own experience and to improve my skills in Angular development.
